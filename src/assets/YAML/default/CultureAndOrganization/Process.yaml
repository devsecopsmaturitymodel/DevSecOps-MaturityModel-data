    Approval by reviewing any new version:
      uuid: 3f63bdbc-c75f-4780-a941-e6ad42e894e1
      risk:
        An individual might forget to implement security measures to protect source
        code or infrastructure components.
      measure:
        On each new version (e.g. Pull Request) of source code or infrastructure
        components a security peer review of the changes is performed (two eyes principle)
        and approval given by the reviewer.

    Definition of a change management process:

      risk:
        The impact of a change is not controlled because these are not recorded
        or documented.
      measure: Each change of a system is automatically recorded and adequately logged.

    Definition of simple BCDR practices for critical components:
      uuid: c72da779-86cc-45b1-a339-190ce5093171
      description:
        A _Business Continuity and Disaster Recovery_ (BCDR) is a plan and a process
        that helps a business to return to normal operations if a disaster occurs.
      risk:
        If the disaster recovery actions are not clear, you risk slow reaction and remediation delays.
        This applies to cyber attacks as well as natural emergencies, such as a power outage.
      measure:
        By understanding and documenting a business continuity and disaster
        recovery (BCDR) plan, the overall availability of systems and applications
        is increased. Success factors like responsibilities, Service Level Agreements,
        Recovery Point Objectives, Recovery Time Objectives or Failover must be fully
        documented and understood by the people involved in the recovery.

    Determining the protection requirement:

      risk: |-
        Not defining the protection requirement of applications can lead to wrong prioritization, delayed remediation of 
        critical security issues, increasing the risk of exploitation and potential damage to the organization.
      measure: |-
        Defining the protection requirement. 
        The protection requirements for an application should consider:
        - Processed data criticality
        - Application accessibility (internal vs. external)
        - Regulatory compliance
        - Other relevant factors
