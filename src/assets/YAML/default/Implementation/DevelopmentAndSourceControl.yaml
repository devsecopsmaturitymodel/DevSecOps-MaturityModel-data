    Block force pushes:
      uuid: c7d99b18-c3e1-4d22-b2e3-9aa9146c0b17
      risk: |-
        Misuse of force push can lead to loss of work. It may overwrite remote 
        branches without warning, potentially erasing valuable contributions from team members. This can disrupt collaboration, 
        cause data loss, and create confusion in the development process.
        
        Bypassing the pull request process might remove an important code review step. 
        This increases the risk of merging low-quality or buggy code into the main branch, potentially introducing bugs in the codebase.
      measure: >-
        Mandate blocking of force pushes in the version control platform.
