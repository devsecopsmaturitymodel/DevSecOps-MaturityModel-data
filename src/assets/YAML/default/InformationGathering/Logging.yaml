    Attribution Analysis and IOC Sharing:
      uuid: i9j0k1l2-m3n4-5678-ijkl-901234567890
      description: |
        Threat landscape analysis with MITRE ATT&CK mapping: `attack-navigator --layer techniques.json`
        for TTP visualization, automated attribution reporting via REST APIs,
        and vulnerability assessment integration with attack vector analysis.
      risk: Recovery efforts without comprehensive threat analysis leave organizations vulnerable to similar attacks and fail to contribute to community defense through intelligence sharing.
      measure: 
        Deploy recovery workflows with threat landscape analysis tools,
        attribution reporting with IOC generation for community sharing,
        vulnerability assessment based on attack TTPs,
        and long-term threat actor monitoring.

    Tactical OSINT Training Program:
      uuid: j0k1l2m3-n4o5-6789-jklm-012345678901
      description: |
        Skills-based OSINT training: `recon-ng -w domain_enum -m recon/domains-hosts/brute_hosts`
        for reconnaissance techniques, threat hunt simulation exercises,
        and cross-team collaboration workshops with scenario-based learning.
      risk: Teams without current OSINT skills cannot effectively investigate incidents, conduct threat attribution, or leverage external intelligence for proactive defense.
      measure: 
        Conduct technical OSINT training with hands-on tool usage,
        threat hunting simulation exercises,
        incident response tabletop scenarios,
        and skills assessment with certification tracking.
