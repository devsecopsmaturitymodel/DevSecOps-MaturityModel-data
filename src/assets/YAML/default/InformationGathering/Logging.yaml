    Incident Containment and Eradication:
      uuid: h8i9j0k1-l2m3-4567-hijk-890123456789
      description: |
        OSINT-enhanced containment and eradication procedures:
        - Threat infrastructure mapping using passive DNS and certificate analysis
        - Attack campaign tracking to identify additional compromised systems
        - IOC generation and sharing for community defense
        - Attribution analysis to understand threat actor methods and motivations
        - Infrastructure takedown coordination with hosting providers and registrars
        - Real-time threat landscape monitoring during incident response
      risk: Containment efforts without external intelligence context may miss related infrastructure, fail to prevent reinfection, and allow threat actors to continue operations against other targets.
      measure: Establish procedures to contain security incidents, eliminate the root cause, and remove malicious artifacts while preserving evidence for investigation.

    Incident Recovery and Post-Incident Analysis:
      uuid: i9j0k1l2-m3n4-5678-ijkl-901234567890
      description: |
        Intelligence-driven recovery and analysis processes:
        - Threat landscape analysis to identify ongoing risks and similar campaigns
        - Attribution reporting with indicators for threat intelligence sharing
        - Vulnerability assessment based on attack methods and exploitation techniques
        - Industry threat briefings to warn of similar attacks against peer organizations
        - Long-term monitoring for threat actor return or infrastructure reuse
        - Integration of lessons learned into threat detection and prevention systems
      risk: Recovery efforts without comprehensive threat analysis leave organizations vulnerable to similar attacks and fail to contribute to community defense through intelligence sharing.
      measure: Implement recovery procedures to restore normal operations and conduct post-incident analysis to identify lessons learned and implement improvements to prevent similar incidents.

    Incident Response Training and Testing:

      description: |
        Comprehensive training program incorporating OSINT and threat intelligence:
        - Hands-on OSINT training for incident responders and analysts
        - Threat intelligence platform training for indicator enrichment and analysis
        - Tabletop exercises based on real-world attack campaigns and threat actor TTPs
        - Red team exercises incorporating current threat intelligence and attack methods
        - Cross-functional training between security operations and threat intelligence teams
        - Regular updates on emerging threats, tools, and investigation techniques
      risk: Training programs that don't incorporate current threat intelligence and OSINT capabilities leave teams unprepared for sophisticated attacks and limit their ability to conduct effective threat attribution and campaign analysis.
      measure: Conduct regular incident response training for team members and perform tabletop exercises, simulations, and drills to test and improve incident response procedures.
