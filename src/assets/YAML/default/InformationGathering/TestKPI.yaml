      risk: |-
        Without measuring Mean Time to Resolution (MTTR) related to patching, it is challenging to identify delays in the patching process. Unaddressed vulnerabilities can be exploited by attackers, leading to potential security breaches and data loss.
      measure: |-
        Measurement and communication of patching Mean Time to Resolution (MTTR) in alignment with Service Level Agreements (SLAs), conducted at least on a quarterly basis.
        This includes the measurement of the existence of a properly configured automated pull request (PR) tool (e.g., Dependabot or Renovate) in a repository. 
        In addition, the measurement of the time from opening an automated PR to merging it.
        
        Average time to patch is visualized per component/project/team.
