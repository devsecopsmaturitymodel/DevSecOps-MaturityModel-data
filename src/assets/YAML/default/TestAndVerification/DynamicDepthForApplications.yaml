    Coverage of client side dynamic components:
      uuid: 9711f871-f79d-4573-8d4f-d2c98fd0d18e
      risk:
        Parts of the service are not covered during the scan, because JavaScript
        is not getting executed. Therefore, the coverage of client-side dynamic
        components is limited, leading to potential security risks and undetected
        vulnerabilities.
      measure:
        Usage of a spider which executes dynamic content like JavaScript, e.g.
        via Selenium.

    Coverage of more input vectors:

      risk:
        Parts of the service are not covered. For example specially formatted
        or coded parameters are not getting detected as parameter (e.g. parameters
        in REST-like URLs, parameters in JSON-Format or base64-coded parameters).

        Deficient security tests are performed. Simple vulnerabilities are not
        detected and missing security configurations (e.g. headers) are not set. Fast
        feedback is not given.
      measure:
        A simple scan is performed to get a security baseline. In case the
        test is done in under 10 minutes, it should be part of the build and deployment
        process.
