Test and Verification:
  Test-Intensity:
    Creation and application of a testing concept:
      uuid: 79ef8103-e1ed-4055-8df8-fd2b2015bebe
      risk: Scans might use a too small or too high test intensity.
      measure:
        A testing concept considering the amount of time per scan/intensity
        is created and applied. A dynamic analysis needs more time than a static analysis.
        The dynamic scan, depending on the test intensity might be performed on every
        commit, every night, every week or once in a month.

    Deactivating of unneeded tests:
      uuid: 1bd78cdd-ef11-4bb5-9b58-5af2e25fe1c5
      risk:
        As tools cover a wide range of different vulnerability tests, they might
        not match the used components. Therefore, they need more time and resources
        as they need and the feedback loops takes too much time.
      measure:
        Unneeded tests are deactivated. For example in case the service is
        using a Mongo database and no mysql database, the dynamic scan doesn't need
        to test for sql injections.

    Default settings for intensity:
      uuid: ab0a4b51-3b18-43f1-a6fc-a98e4b28453d
      risk:
        Time pressure and ignorance might lead to false predictions for the test
        intensity.
      measure: The intensity of the used tools are not modified to save time.

    High test intensity:

      risk:
        A too small intensity or a too high confidence might lead to not visible
        vulnerabilities.
      measure:
        A deep scan with high test intensity and a low confidence threshold
        is performed.

    Regular automated tests:
      uuid: 598897a2-358e-441f-984c-e12ec4f6110a
      risk:
        After pushing source code to the version control system, any delay in
        receiving feedback on defects makes them harder for the developer to remediate.
      measure:
        On each push and/or at given intervals automatic security tests are
        performed.
