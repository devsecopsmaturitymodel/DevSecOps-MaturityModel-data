        due to an unexpected load the availability is disturbed.
      measure:
        Load test against the production system or a production near system
        is performed.

      risk:
        Standard network segmentation and firewalling has not been performed,

      measure:
        With the help of tools the network configuration of unintentional exposed
        cluster(s) are tested. To identify clusters, all subdomains might need to
        be identified with a tool like OWASP Amass to perform port scans based o the
        result.

      measure:
        Components must be whitelisted. Regular scans on the docker infrastructure
        (e.g. cluster) need to be performed, to verify that only standardized base

      risk:
        Unused resources, specially secrets, might be still valid, but are exposing
        information. As an attacker, I compromise a system, gather credentials and
        try to use them.
      measure: Test for unused resources helps to identify unused resources.

    Test network segmentation:

        Wrong or no network segmentation of pods makes it easier for an attacker
        to access a database and extract or modify data.
      measure:
        Cluster internal test needs to be performed. Integration of fine granulated
        network segmentation (also between pods in the same namespace).

    Weak password test:

        Weak passwords in components like applications or systems, specially for
